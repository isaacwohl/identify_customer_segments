# Identifying Customer Segments
This is an unsupervised Learning project for Udacity’s “Machine Learning – Introduction” nanodegree program. It applies unsupervised learning methods to a population of customers for a German mail-order company.

I used Python 3.6.9.

This project was reviewed by a Udacity reviewer.
